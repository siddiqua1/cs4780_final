Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The programming project provide templates for how to do this, and the most recent video lectures summarize some of the tricks you will need (e.g. feature normalization, feature construction). So, this final project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",

Economic and sociological factors vary a lot among counties in the United States. In addition, as you may observe from the election map of recent elections, neighbor counties show similar patterns in terms of the voting results. In this project you will bring the power of machine learning to make predictions for the county-level election results using Economic and sociological factors and the geographic structure of US counties. </p>\n",

        "We first got rid of sections of the training data we decided should not be on a Training vector. This included FIPS and County. The identification number and county name should have no correlation to the votes. We also removed Dem and GOP columns and converted them into our y values, 0 means Dem win and 1 for GOP win. We also had to convert the numbers from strings into numeric values. This meant we had to remove the commas. We then normalized the data from 0 to 1 to make numbers mean something relative to the other data. \n",

        "We chose a Kernelized SVM because we thought that it would perform well with the data given to us. We hoped that in some dimension it would be separable. We then did a Naive Bayes training algorithm. We chose this because we thought that certain features such as median income, bachelor rate and unemployment rate would have more drastic effects on the outcome of the county. For example, High Bachelor rate may imply a more college graduates which have shown to vote more democratic in recent studies.\n",

        "We split the data into a training set and a validation set. We then performed K-fold cross validation where there were 6 splits so that there was enough data to train on. We also optimized the C value for our SVM function.\n",

        "3.2.2 We changed our machine learning algorithm to a neural network. We had also added 5 new features that we believed could provide some useful information. We calculated the Population rate of change since counties with more people entering could indicate a growing younger population/families where young people and women tend to vote democratic. Bachelor's degree to unemployment ratio since this could indicate a higher educated population, and especially young people without jobs but with bachelor's degrees. An estimate on total population income per year a rough estimate to calculate whether there are many high-paying jobs and less of a blue-collar working county. The ratio of educated to unemployed relative multiplied by the median income since this could suggest how much bachelor’s impact the median income suggesting either a low skilled work. Finally, we included a change in the ratio among the newly educated population which could suggest again of new and younger people entering a county which I have previously mentioned.\n"
