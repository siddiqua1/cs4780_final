# cs4780_final

Final for CS 4780. 

Utilized demographic data from 2016 to train multiple models for prediciting voting results in 2020. 
The process included importing and cleaning up data, feature extraction, and finally model tweaking and training to reach the set accuracy on the Kaggle competition set up for the class.\
Three models in total were used through out the project: SVM, Gaussian Bayes, and a Neural Network.

Python 3.X (Done on Google Colab)
Dependencies: pandas, numpy, sklearn, pytorch

Set the [dataset_path] correctly if the project is not being run on google colab.
